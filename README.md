Working in several fast-paced retail environments has taught me to remain alert and attentive during the busiest periods, coordinating with my peers, following instructions and working as a team. 

## Hobbies

Sports: I have a great passion for surfing, and when the conditions permit, I will often travel to Cornwall or even Morroco to escape the big city and return refreshed, more mindful and motivated for work. I am a confident cyclist, especially keen on mountain biking and BMXing. Other sports include football (in teams for both 11 and 6 a side at University), skiing, and table tennis.

Hobbies: I have represented the University in Pool and Snooker tournaments and reached the
semi-finals of internal competitions. I am a keen photographer with an interest in art and have
enjoyed drawing and painting from a young age.

Music: I am very passionate about guitar. Playing for 14 years, I practice on average half an hour
a day.. I have also played piano for 5 years and enjoy playing advanced classical pieces.
Other interests: Travelling (South America for 4 months), film, literature and politics.
