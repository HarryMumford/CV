## Skills

***Building client relationships*** - My professional experience as a Mining Consultant / Geotechnical Engineer has dramatically improved my ability to build client relationships. This role relied heavily on my ability to express complex technical concepts to customers, who often had very little knowledge about the services we offered or even mining as a whole.  Our services were often expensive and intrusive, involving excavation and drilling beneath properties. Sometimes the result of these investigations would come as a shock to the client. It was therefore vital that I discussed the details of the investigations in a professional manner and was able to answer any technical mining-related queries the customer had. Throughout my 30+ investigations, I received 100% positive feedback on my customer service. 

***Problem Solving*** - Since starting coding I have realised that I use a logical approach for almost everything in life; whether it be playing a strategy board game, planning and engineering a drilling project or attempting a difficult kata on codewars. I have a keen eye for spotting improvements and introducing new techniques to increase the efficiency and quality of company processes. For example in my previous job technical diagrams were being produced in graphic design software while the geospatial analysis was performed on GIS software. I noticed this was problematic as any changes to the scale required time-consuming conversions to update the diagrams on the graphical software. This also encouraged human error. Utilising graphical tools within QGIS, I was able to streamline the diagram production process. I also realised there was scope for further improvement and with help from the developers I wrote some basic code to automate diagram production that required dependent scaling.

***Eagerness to learn*** - When presented with a new problem or technology, I do not shy away or become overwhelmed. Instead, I embrace the challenge and feel a great sense of reward when I see a noticeable improvement. From a young age, I would become fixated on a new hobby or passion. As soon I started something I would be determined to get it to a high standard. Often when I accomplished this I would be looking for something new to learn. However, I started playing the guitar when I was 8 and still play every day, 17 years on. With so many techniques, styles, and theories still to learn I never feel complacent and as soon as I master a song I want to learn a more complex one. I feel the same with coding; I get immense satisfaction from finally understanding something I’ve been struggling with for ages but then pretty soon I’ll be looking for the next thing to learn. Luckily in the forever changing tech-industry, the learning curve is limitless.

***Communication / Team Work*** - During our group projects at Makers Academy I helped ensure our teams communicated effectively by sticking to a structured agile environment. We ensured the tasks were divided equally and appropriately to maximise efficiency.  In my previous job, worked in many different areas of the company. Using my communication and people skills, I was able to listen to my peers and adapt quickly to unfamiliar roles. I was then able to take the lead on geotechnical and land contamination projects despite being formally trained as a mining-consultant.

***Science/engineering background*** I have a strong technical mindset. From secondary school to university I have always been drawn to science and maths. I found it much easier to revise for those subjects as solutions to equations were not subjective and did not require retaining lots of information. For this reason, I chose the advanced maths modules in my geology degree and achieved highly in them. 

## Education

## Experience

***Cornwall Consultants*** (July 2018 - October 2019)  
*Mining Consultant* 

* Supervised and engineered numerous drilling and excavation projects through their full lifecycle.
* Utilised GIS software to automate technical diagramming thus increasing efficiency and profit margins. 
* Used strategic planning to ensure the client’s requirements were met in the shortest time possible.
* Shadowed the company’s developers and learnt how they used python to interact with QGIS and PostgreSQL.
* Passed on the valuable skills I gained from Makers Academy, offering advice on automated testing, TDD process and version control.


***Various summer jobs*** (2012 - 2017)   
*Customer assistant, waiter, carer, cashier, cleaner and gardener*

* Worked several fast-paced retail environments which taught me to remain alert and attentive during the busiest periods, coordinating with my peers, following instructions and working as a team. 

## Interests

I have a great passion for surfing, and when the conditions permit, I will often travel to Cornwall or even Morocco to escape the big city and return refreshed, more mindful and motivated for work. I am a confident cyclist, especially keen on mountain biking and BMXing. Other sports include football (in teams for both 11 and 6 a side at University), skiing, and table tennis. I have represented the University in pool and snooker tournaments and reached the semi-finals of internal competitions. I am very passionate about the guitar. Playing for 17 years, I practice on average half an hour a day. I have also played the piano for 8 years and enjoy playing advanced classical pieces.
