Driven by my competitive nature, and passion for learning I am determined to achieve my goal of becoming a software developer. 

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.

## Skills

***Fast learning*** - I purposely chose a challenging final project to test my ability to pick up a learn a new tech-stack and solve a tough problem. In under 10 days I was able to get a firm understanding of Reacts client-side rendering and using Mongo db and Express to save state. My love of learning is also demonstrated by my large and varied amount of sports and hobbies including snooker, surfing, skimboarding, guitar, piano, slack-lining, photography, table tennis, bmxing, unicycling and football. 

***Problem Solving*** - Since I have started coding I have realised that I use a logical approach for almost everything in life. Whether it be playing a strategy board game, planning and engineering a drilling project in my previous job or attempting a difficult kata on codewars. 

***Communication / Team Work***

## Experience

***Cornwall Consultants*** (July, 2018 - Ocotober, 2019)  
*Mining Consultant*  


***Various summer jobs*** (2012 - 2017)   
*Customer assistant, waiter, carer, cashier, cleaner and gardener*  
Working in several fast-paced retail environments has taught me to remain alert and attentive during the busiest periods, coordinating with my peers, following instructions and working as a team. 

## Interests

Sports: I have a great passion for surfing, and when the conditions permit, I will often travel to Cornwall or even Morroco to escape the big city and return refreshed, more mindful and motivated for work. I am a confident cyclist, especially keen on mountain biking and BMXing. Other sports include football (in teams for both 11 and 6 a side at University), skiing, and table tennis.

Hobbies: I have represented the University in Pool and Snooker tournaments and reached the
semi-finals of internal competitions. I am a keen photographer with an interest in art and have
enjoyed drawing and painting from a young age.

Music: I am very passionate about guitar. Playing for 16 years, I practice on average half an hour
a day. I have also played piano for 7 years and enjoy playing advanced classical pieces.
Other interests: Travelling (South America for 4 months), film, literature and politics.
